        I am a fullstack .NET software developer with a penchant for React. I
        was born in South Africa, and have lived in the UK, Austria and Spain,
        before settling in Sweden. It was in Stockholm where I discovered the
        fullstack course at the School of Applied Technology, allowing me to
        leave the hospitality industry after 15 years and finally begin my
        career in programming.
